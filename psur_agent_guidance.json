The observed complaint rate of 0.42% exceeded the Upper Control Limit of 0.31% and the maximum expected rate of occurrence of 0.25% established in the Risk Assessment and Control Table. Investigation identified a change in membrane supplier raw material properties as the root cause. A Field Safety Corrective Action (FSCA-2024-003) was initiated in June 2024 to notify affected customers, and CAPA-2024-011 was opened to implement enhanced incoming inspection criteria and qualify an alternative membrane material.

Two new markets were entered during the reporting period: Australia contributed 285 units (3.3%) and Japan contributed 95 units (1.1%) following regulatory approvals in those markets. The increasing global distribution and growing sales volume provide a robust denominator for complaint rate calculations and improve the statistical sensitivity for trend detection in the vigilance and complaint analyses presented in Sections D through G.

No deaths were reported. Both incidents were classified as malfunctions with no associated patient injury. The first incident (complaint FCB-2024-0187) involved electrode wire fracture during the excision procedure, classified under IMDRF Medical Device Problem code A0502 (Device Breakage). Investigation findings under IMDRF Annex C identified the cause as material fatigue in the electrode wire at the junction point with the handle. The electrode fragment was recovered, and the procedure was completed using a replacement device with no adverse clinical outcome. The second incident (complaint FCB-2024-0312) involved failure of the depth stop mechanism, classified under IMDRF Medical Device Problem code A0701 (Failure of Device to Self-Test or Self-Check). The clinician identified the malfunction before initiating the excision and replaced the device, resulting in no patient harm. Investigation found the depth stop component had been deformed during shipping. Both incidents were within the maximum expected rate of occurrence of 0.05% established in the Risk Assessment and Control Table (RMF-0042-RACT). The serious incident rate of 0.023% in the current period is consistent with the preceding period rate of 0.028% (2 incidents per 7,045 units) and does not indicate an upward trend.

The numerator includes all product quality complaints documented in the complaint handling system where the reported issue relates to device performance, safety, or quality. Administrative complaints (e.g., order errors, pricing disputes) and shipping damage complaints unrelated to device integrity are excluded from the numerator. The denominator uses units distributed within each time period as reported in Section C, Table 1. This methodology is appropriate for the Fischer Cone Biopsy Excisor because the device is a sterile single-use product where each unit sold corresponds to approximately one patient exposure. This calculation methodology has been applied consistently across all PSUR cycles for this device, enabling direct period-over-period trend comparison."

The corrective action comprised implementation of 100% incoming inspection for electrode wire diameter with tightened acceptance criteria (from ±0.05mm to ±0.02mm tolerance).

All complaint rates remained within the maximum expected rates of occurrence established in the Risk Assessment and Control Table. Statistical trend analysis using Upper Control Limit methodology confirmed that no statistically significant adverse trends were present. The serious incident rate of 0.023% was below the RACT threshold and both incidents resulted in no patient harm.

However, combined global data across all markets was sufficient for robust analysis. Second, the population exposure estimate is based on units sold rather than units used, which may overstate the denominator by including devices in distributor inventory that have not yet been used. This would have a conservative effect on complaint rate calculations (i.e., actual rates may be slightly higher than reported). Despite these limitations, the data set of 8,547 units sold and 31 complaints across 12 markets over a full 12-month period is considered adequate for meaningful benefit-risk assessment."
